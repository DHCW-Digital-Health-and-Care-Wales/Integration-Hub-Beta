# Training Mock Receiver Configuration (Week 3)
# =============================================================================
# Environment variables for the mock HL7 receiver used in training.
#
# This reuses the production hl7_mock_receiver image with training-specific
# configuration. The mock receiver:
#   1. Listens on an MLLP port for incoming HL7 messages
#   2. Parses the message and logs it
#   3. Returns an ACK (or NACK if message contains "fail")
#
# UNDERSTANDING THE MOCK RECEIVER:
# -------------------------------
# The mock receiver simulates a real HL7 endpoint.
# It's useful for testing because:
#   - It always responds (no real system required)
#   - It logs received messages (for debugging)
#   - It can return NACKs (for testing error handling)
# =============================================================================

# =====================================================================
# Service Bus Connection (optional - for forwarding received messages)
# =====================================================================
SERVICE_BUS_CONNECTION_STRING=Endpoint=sb://sb-emulator;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=SAS_KEY_VALUE;UseDevelopmentEmulator=true

# EGRESS_QUEUE_NAME: Queue to forward received messages to
#   For training, messages are forwarded to this queue (though nothing consumes it).
#   This is required by the mock receiver application.
EGRESS_QUEUE_NAME=local-inthub-training-mock-receiver
