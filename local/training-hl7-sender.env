# =============================================================================
# Training HL7 Sender Configuration (Week 3)
# =============================================================================
# Environment variables for the training HL7 sender.
#
# The sender reads transformed messages from the egress queue and forwards
# them via MLLP to the mock receiver.
#
# =====================================================================
# Service Bus Connection
# =====================================================================
SERVICE_BUS_CONNECTION_STRING=Endpoint=sb://sb-emulator;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=SAS_KEY_VALUE;UseDevelopmentEmulator=true

# =====================================================================
# Ingress Queue Settings (where we READ messages FROM)
# =====================================================================
# INGRESS_QUEUE_NAME: The queue the sender reads from
#   This is the same queue that the transformer publishes to
#   Must match EGRESS_QUEUE_NAME in training-hl7-transformer.env
INGRESS_QUEUE_NAME=local-inthub-training-egress

# INGRESS_SESSION_ID: Session ID for ordered message processing
#   Must match EGRESS_SESSION_ID in training-hl7-transformer.env
#
#   Session IDs are scoped to individual queues. When a message crosses
#   from one queue to another, a new session scope begins.
INGRESS_SESSION_ID=training

# =====================================================================
# MLLP Destination Settings (where we SEND messages TO)
# =====================================================================
# RECEIVER_MLLP_HOST: Hostname of the MLLP receiver
#   In Docker, use the container name as hostname
#   The mock receiver is running as 'training-hl7-mock-receiver'
RECEIVER_MLLP_HOST=training-hl7-mock-receiver

# RECEIVER_MLLP_PORT: Port of the MLLP receiver
#   The mock receiver is configured to listen on port 2591
RECEIVER_MLLP_PORT=2591

# ACK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS: How long to wait for an ACK response
#   If the receiver doesn't respond within this time, the send fails
#   30 seconds is a reasonable default for most scenarios
ACK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30

# =====================================================================
# Logging
# =====================================================================
# LOG_LEVEL: Controls verbosity of log output
#   DEBUG: Very detailed output (shows ACK parsing details)
#   INFO: Normal operation messages (recommended for training)
#   WARN: Only warnings and errors
#   ERROR: Only errors
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# AZURE_LOG_LEVEL: Controls Azure SDK logging
#   The Azure SDK can be very verbose, so we usually set this higher
AZURE_LOG_LEVEL=WARN
